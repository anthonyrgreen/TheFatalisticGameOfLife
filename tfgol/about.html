<div class="c"><h2>About</h2></div>

<p class="sp">The Fatalistic Game of Life is an actuarial statistics toy designed to generate a hypothetical person based off of statistical models of the population of the western world. You can track this person as they age, go to school, marry, get jobs, and eventually die. You can also reach into the hypothetical person's life and change some key variable to see how life would have turned out with that change. What would happen if my first job paid twice what it did? What would happen if I spent 3 months in prison when I was 30?<br>The data is primarily taken from the 2012 US census, and is fairly well broken down by cohorts of age, gender, and race. Occupation is, as yet, uncorrelated to the income, race, and gender. Net worth is simply a sum of 10% of lifetime income.<br>Future features include the ability to add life events -- mariage, car accidents, prison time, and so on -- to visualize how these affect the progress of an average life.<br><br><b>Authors</b><br>Anthony Green<br>Jason Terranova<br>Charles Vink</p>
