<p class="sp">The Fatalistic Game of Life is an actuarial statistics toy designed to generate a hypothetical person based off of statistical models of the population of the western world. You can track this person as they age, go to school, marry, get jobs, and eventually die. You can also reach into the hypothetical person's life and change some key variable to see how life would have turned out with that change. What would happen if my first job paid twice what it did? What would happen if I spent 3 months in prison when I was 30?<br><br><b>Authors</b><br>Anthony Green<br>Jason Terranova<br>Charles Vink</p>
